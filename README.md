# electron_react_python_test
Exploring completely how to call, pass inputs to, and receive outputs from, a python program that can be bundled onto the main standalone Electron application. Uses a GUI powered by React to pass in argv, stdin, receive stdout, start/end the program.

The python code must be compiled to an executable on each platform (I used pyinstaller).
